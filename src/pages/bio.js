      <h1>Jon Jones</h1>
      <div className="biotxt"> 
      Born July 19, 1987 is an American professional mixed martial artist currently signed to the Ultimate Fighting Championship, where he has competed in the light heavyweight division. He is a former two-time UFC Light Heavyweight Champion. Jones first held the title from March 2011 to April 2015, and then from December 2018 to August 17, 2020, when he vacated the title. Jones has also held the interim UFC Light Heavyweight Championship. As of October 27, 2020, he is #2 in the UFC men's pound-for-pound rankings.

At age 23, with his victory over Maurício Rua at UFC 128, Jones became the youngest champion in UFC history.He holds many UFC records in the light heavyweight division, including the most title defenses, most wins, longest win streak, and most submission victories. During much of his championship reign, Jones has been widely considered to be the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world. Never stopped nor outscored during his career, Jones's only professional loss is a controversial disqualification against Matt Hamill, a result that Hamill and UFC President Dana White dispute.

Between 2015 and 2017, Jones was involved in several controversies and lost his title three times as a result of disciplinary action. He was first stripped of his title and removed from the official rankings by the UFC in 2015 after he was arrested on felony hit-and-run charges. His subsequent returns to the UFC in 2016 and 2017 saw him emerge victorious in title bouts against Ovince Saint Preux and Daniel Cormier, but were both cut short by Jones testing positive for banned substances and receiving further suspensions, with the latter reversed to a 'no contest'.After his 2017 suspension was lifted, Jones reclaimed the championship in 2018 by defeating Alexander Gustafsson, (in a match in which the winner would also win the vacated title) and successfully defended it in his three following fights.
